## Course Description

These series of webinars and tutorials aim at improving basic and applied knowledge associated with next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and their applications in the field of Tuberculosis (TB).

The trainings will introduce scalable and reproducible data analysis with Galaxy of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* complex (MTBC) genomes.

A series of pre-recorded sessions and hands-on tutorials will show:
  - How to differentiate sequencing technologies and which ones are most commonly applied in TB and how **(Day 1)**
  - How NGS can be implement into TB laboratories **(Day 1)**
  - How to do mapping and variant calling **(Day 2)**
  - How to detect drug resistance conferring mutations, build phylogenetic trees and infer tuberculosis transmission **(Day 3)**
  - How to use different web tools dedicated to targeted analysis and what it takes to do bioinformatics **(Day 4)**.

After the trainings all participants are expected to:
  - Describe how NGS is being used in TB research and clinical pratice
  - Extract MTBC genomic variants from short sequencing reads
  - Identify drug resistant mutations
  - Identify genetic relationships and interpret a phylogenetic trees
  - Use web applications designed for M. tuberculosis

- Certificates 

## After the Course
All these materials will remain online, so you can continue working on them for as long as you want. The only difference will be that you should ask your questions on the [GTN Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby), instead of Slack.
